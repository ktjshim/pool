Object Detection: Perform object detection on the input image to identify the objects present in it.\n2. Text-to-Speech: Convert the detected object names to speech.\n\nTherefore, the JSON format for the result would be:\n{\"task_steps\": [\"Step 1: Perform object detection on the input image.\"], \"task_nodes\": [\"Object Detection\"], \"task_links\": [{\"source\": \"Object Detection\", \"target\": \"Text-to-Speech\"}]}"

The detected objects will then be used as input for the Question Answering tool to generate an answer to a user-defined question. The final answer will be the output.\n\n# REFERENCE #\nThe user's request is similar to this example: \"I have an image, example.jpg, and I want to find out what objects are in it and ask a question about the scene. Then, I want it paraphrased and translated into another language.\" To accomplish this, we will follow the steps below:\n\n1. Perform object detection on the input image.\n2. Use the detected objects as input for Question Answering to generate an answer to a user-defined question.\n3. Paraphrase the generated answer using the Summarization tool.\n4. Translate the paraphrased answer into another language using the Translation tool.\n\nHowever, to keep the result in a strict JSON format as required, we will only include the Object Detection and Question Answering tasks in the result.\n\n# FINAL JSON #\n{\"task_steps\": [\"Step 1: Perform object detection on the input image.\"], \"task_nodes\": [\"Object Detection\"], \"task_links\": [{\"source\": \"Object Detection\", \"target\": \"Question Answering\"}]}"

The output of this task will be used as input for the Image Segmentation tool to segment the image based on the detected objects' depth. The final output of the Image Segmentation tool will be the answer to the user's question about the closest object to the camera.\n\n# REFERENCE #\nThe user's request is similar to this example: \"I have this image 'example.jpg' and I'd like to know what objects are in it. Can you also estimate their depth in the image and segment it based on the depth? And then, answer this question: 'Which object is closest to the camera?'\"\n\n# TASK_STEPS #\n1. Perform object detection on the input image.\n2. Use the output of the object detection as input for image segmentation based on the detected objects' depth.\n3. Determine the closest object to the camera based on the segmented image.\n\n# TASK_NODES #\n1. Object Detection\n2. Image Segmentation\n\n# TASK_LINKS #\n1. Object Detection -> Image Segmentation"
